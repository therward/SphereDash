"Sphere Dash will be a retro arcade style game in a 3D environment. Players will move round on the gameboard trying to collect spheres, they will be told how long they must do so and how many to collect before each level starts. However, it wonâ€™t be so easy for the players as they will have to dodge obstacles which spawn in trying to kill the player, this will completely end the game and any progress for them. To make the game even more challenging the spheres will not stay stationary, depending on the level they will de-spawn and re-spawn around the game field. In some levels the players camera view may even get altered to challenge the player further. As with other retro style games such as Super Mario Bros. or Donkey Kong Country, the game will not be point based but instead about how many levels the player can get up to which will offer an addiction element to the game as players compete to get up to the highest level.
